Goal: Based on your experience with teams in this course, create your own Team Contract for this project that describes your team work goals and responsibilities (and is "signed" by everyone). Make sure to include these topics: communication goals, identifying the quality of work everyone wishes to achieve, the level of group participation and individual accountability everyone feels comfortable with, how to make the team a safe place for everyone to participate, and meeting frequency. 

In addition to the basic contract from previous projects, here are some guidelines and a typical Open Source project's Code of Conduct to help get you started. As a reminder, here are the individual expectations for course team projects.

## Communication Goals
* Stick to planned API when possible
    * If API changes are deemed necessary make sure to meet with everyone and discuss changes with all subteams (model, view, controller) so that each member is on the same page for what needs to be changed. 
* Never refactor someone else's code without communicating with them
* If you're genuinely stuck, reach out to others before deadlines creep up

## Quality of Work

We're expected to put out work that reflects our responsibilities, effort, and good software design that we learned in class:

* Team Presentations: Meeting on Monday to get everybody on the same page and work together on creating a presentation that demonstrates what we've accomplished in the sprint and plan to accomplish in the next sprint.
* Collaborative Writing: Working together with people on the same-end/full-stack people to write down clear and understandable documentation
* Individual Research: Teammates should conduct research on design and documentation research on JavaFX that allows them to implement great design as well as understand what their responsibilities are
* Peer Review: Teammates will provide each other constructive criticism and help when they notice something or are asked for help

Strategies to accomplish this include:
* Meeting with the entire team at least once a week where we voice opinions and problems, seek to integrate our changes, and get everyone on the same level of understanding
* Meeting with your end (front or back or full) team often to develop
* Keeping strong communication on issues we run into and ideas we have


## Level of Group Participation
Everyone should be present and ready to communicate their updates and concerns at our scheduled full-team meetings, to the best of their ability. Ideally everybody will put in the same amount of work throughout the course of the project, however the amount of work done in a particular week can fluctuate based on scheduling.


## Individual Accountability
Each Individual will be accountable for completing their assigned git issues by the indicated due date. If there is a need to extend the due date the individual(s) assigned to the issue will need to document an explanation for the extension and will update the git issue accordingly. In terms of sharing git issues, team members will try to finish enough git issues so that by the end of the project everyone will have completed around the same "weight" amount of issues.


## Safe Place
* There is not really a place for putting down teammates or mocking other people's efforts because we're all in the same boat and doing our best to finish the project  
* Everyone should be able to bring up concerns, ideas, comments , etc... without others being critical of their ideas.

## Meeting Frequency
The team will meet all together at 10 PM on Mondays, and each individual subteam, that is front-end, back-end, and controller, will meet on Thursdays after lab and as needed.
