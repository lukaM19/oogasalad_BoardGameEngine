# Backlog

### Specifications

Write at least ten Use Cases per team member that describe specific features each person expects to complete â€” these will serve as the project's initial Backlog. Focus on features you plan to complete during the first two Sprints (i.e., the project's highest priority features). Note, they can be similar to those given in the assignment specification, but should include more detail specific to your project's goals. It may help to role play or draw a diagram of how your classes collaborate to complete each case.

### Luka Mdivani

* Use case 1 - user initializes a Moving object
```java
    // in grid we initialize an Piece subclass MovingPiece with reflection
    // in constructor:
  public interface MovingPiece(){
  public MovingPice(Coordinate[] movementPath,Coordinate[] shape){
    this.setPath(movementPath);
    this.setStatus("Alive");
    this.initializeShape(shape);
  } 
}
  
```
* Use case 2 - a ship is hit
```java
    // if the traget grid is is identified as a ship grid in the Grid.java
    Piece shisp = new Piece();
    ship.registerDamage(Coordinate location);
    //Inside ship:
    pubic interface  registerDamage(Coordinate location){
      occupiedCells.remove(location);
      checkPieceStatus();
}
  
```
* Use case 3 - a ship is hit and it sinks
```java
   
  public interface checkPieceStatus(){
  if( occupiedCells.size() == 0 )
    {
      setStatus("Dead");
    }
  }
  
```
* Use case 4 - a MovingPiece is hit and its movement ability is disabled
```java
   
  public interface checkPieceStatus(){
  if( occupiedCells.size() == 0 )
    {
      setStatus("Dead");
    }
  if(!status.equals("damaged")){
    setStatus("damaged");
    disableMovementStatus();
    }
  }
  
```
* Use case 5 - Piece has to move 
```java
// Inside Piece
public interface updateLocation(){
  for( Coordinate cell : occupiedCells ){
    for(Coordinate direction : path) {
      if(inBounds()){
      cell.x + path.x;
      cell.y + path.y;
      }
    }
  }
}

```
* Use case 6 - Piece has to move and path leads it out of bounds
```java
// Inside Piece
public interface updateLocation(){
  if (movementStatus)

  {
    for (Coordinate cell : occupiedCells) {
      for (Coordinate direction : path) {
        if (inBounds()) {
          cell.x + path.x;
          cell.y + path.y;
        } else
          () {
          disableMovementStatus();
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
