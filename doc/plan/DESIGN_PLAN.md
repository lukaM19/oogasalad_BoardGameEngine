# Design Plan

### Specifications

Write your design goals (i.e., where is it most flexible), and the design's primary architecture (i.e., what is closed and what is open) without committing to any concrete implementation (i.e., do not reference specific classes, data structures, or code). This should emphasize the abstractions you will create to capture your game or genre's key commonalities and differences. Describe how your intended design will handle your team's goals for the project's basic and extended functionality using APIs to provide services rather than simple classes. For each API you plan to build, provide a roughly "one page" high-level design overview using the format below. Include a picture of how the modules are related (these pictures can be hand drawn and scanned, saved from an online CRC card tool, written in Markdown, created with a standard drawing program, or screen shots from a UML design program).
